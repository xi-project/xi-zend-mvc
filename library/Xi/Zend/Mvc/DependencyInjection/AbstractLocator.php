 * that need dependencies. Services shall receive dependencies ONLY through
 * this class and NEVER through globals or static methods.
 * 
 * This class is meant to be subclassed and filled with getters for all kinds
 * of useful things. The getters should provide type information.
 * 
 * The implementations of the getters should just retrieve their artifacts
 * from the Pimple container. The container should be initialized
 * in init(). See http://pimple.sensiolabs.org/ for inspiration on how
 * to set up the container.
